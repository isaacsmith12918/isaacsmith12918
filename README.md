# Work at MedCare MSO

I’m currently working remotely at [MedCare MSO](https://medcaremso.com) with a supportive team of healthcare researchers. My focus is on developing Revenue Cycle Management and EHR content that helps healthcare providers increase profitability and improve efficiency throughout the treatment process.

## Key Areas of Focus

- **[Revenue Cycle Management](https://medcaremso.com/services/revenue-cycle-management/)**: Enhancing the financial performance of healthcare providers by streamlining billing and coding processes.

- **EHR Content**: Improving the user experience and accuracy of Electronic Health Record systems.
